## Overview

This is a browser-based 2D platformer game featuring the iconic character Willy navigating through various rooms, collecting items while avoiding hazards and enemies. The game captures the essence of the original 8-bit classic with modern web technologies.

## Features

- **Classic Platformer Mechanics**: Jump, run, and navigate through challenging rooms
- **Multiple Rooms**: Explore different themed areas including "The Bathroom" and "The Kitchen"
- **Collectible Items**: Gather all items to win the game
- **Hazards & Enemies**: Avoid spikes and moving enemies
- **Lives System**: Traditional arcade-style lives mechanic
- **Score Tracking**: Points awarded for collecting items
- **Pixel Art Style**: Retro aesthetic with crisp pixel rendering

## Game Controls

- **Arrow Keys**: Move left/right
- **Space Bar or Up Arrow**: Jump
- **F5**: Restart game (when game over)

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

The game is built using vanilla JavaScript with HTML5 Canvas for rendering:

- **Game Class**: Main game loop, state management, and coordination
- **Willy Class**: Player character with physics and collision detection
- **Room Class**: Level layout, tile-based collision system
- **Entity Classes**: Items, hazards, and enemies with specialized behaviors

### Key Components

- **Physics Engine**: Custom gravity, jumping, and collision detection
- **Tile-Based Levels**: 16x16 pixel tile system for level design
- **Entity System**: Modular design for game objects
- **Animation System**: Frame-based animations for items and characters

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Modern web browser with HTML5 Canvas support
- No additional dependencies or build tools required

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd jetsetwilly
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser
   ```bash
   # Or use a local server (recommended):
   python -m http.server 8000
   # Then visit http://localhost:8000
   ```

### Development Setup

For development with live reload:

```bash
# Install a simple HTTP server (optional)
npm install -g live-server

# Start development server
live-server
```
